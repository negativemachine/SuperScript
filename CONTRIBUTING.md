# Contributing to Spectral Lab Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
To protect both contributors and maintainers, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, all contributions are subject to the following rules.

## Contributor License Agreement and Developer Certificate of Origin

Depending on the project you contribute to:

### Markdown-Import (MIT license)

- Contributions are accepted under the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**:
  - [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO 1.1)](/docs/legal/developer_certificate_of_origin.md)
- By contributing, you certify that you have the right to submit your code and that you agree to its redistribution under the MIT license.

### All other Spectral Lab projects  
(Preparo, Refero, AutomaticBook suite, BookCreator, Superscript, Inspectora, etc.)

- Contributions are accepted only with a formal agreement:
  - **ICLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement)** if you contribute as an individual:
    - [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](/docs/legal/individual_contributor_license_agreement.md)
  - **CCLA (Corporate Contributor License Agreement)** if you contribute on behalf of a company:
    - [Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)](/docs/legal/corporate_contributor_license_agreement.md)
- These contributions are published under the **AGPL v3** license (strong copyleft) to guarantee that all modifications remain free.
- In some cases (Spectral Cloud), contributed code may be integrated into **proprietary components**.
  - These proprietary components are **not part of the open source repositories** and are distributed under **separate commercial terms**.
  - By contributing, you agree that Spectral Lab may reuse your contribution in its commercial products.
  - Revenues from these products help sustain the **non-profit association** that maintains the project and ensure the continuity of free development.

Spectral Lab retains the right to relicense the Work and Contributions under a dual-licensing model (open source and commercial), as permitted by the ICLA/CCLA.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Spectral Lab, all contributions fall under this framework.
